## Description

This is a Kanban board application implementing JWT-based authentication, ensuring secure user login, session management, and access control. Users can authenticate with JWTs, which are securely stored and automatically expire after inactivity. Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page, and authenticated sessions persist until logout. The application is deployed on Render for access and scalability.

## Installation

- npm i
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Render account


## Usage

In this solution, users can log in with valid credentials, storing a JWT in local storage for authentication. Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page, and inactive sessions expire, requiring reauthentication. Logging out removes the JWT and redirects to the login page.
